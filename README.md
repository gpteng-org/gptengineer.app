This is an issues repo for: **[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)**

Our goal is to create the best experience for rapid prototyping. Feedback in the shape of bugs or feature requests is super helpful.

Feel free to react to tickets that matter most to you to help us prioritize.

## What

[**gptengineer.app**](https://gptengineer.app) enables anyone to:

- Specify what to build
- AI creates a website and display it
- Edit using natural language
- One-click deploy

If you have too many ideas and want to have more products – you have come to the right place.

The code is not here on github, but on [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app).

## Relationship with gpt-engineer
gptengineer.app sprung out of the open source code project [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer). The projects are still connected:
- Governance: gpt-engineer is an independent entity, [governed by a board of its contributors](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)
- Continued Support: A portion of gptengineer.app’s revenue will fund a full-time role and infrastructure for maintaining open-source tools for code generation

The GitHub organisation gpteng-org is created by the original gpt-engineer creator Anton Osika, where gpt-engineer community related projects are collected.


## What's next

We are soon:
- Adding arbitrary full stack capabilities
- Announcing the stacked team and company behind the product
