# gptengineer.app

This is an issues repo for: **[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)**

Our goal is to create the best experience for rapid prototyping. Feedback in the shape of bugs or feature requests is super helpful.

Feel free to react to tickets that matter most to you to help us prioritize.

## What

[**gptengineer.app**](https://gptengineer.app) enables anyone to:

- Specify what to build
- AI creates a website and display it
- Edit using natural language
- One-click deploy

If you have too many ideas and want to have more products â€“ you might have come to the right place in other words.


The code is not here on github, but on [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app).

## Why
Creating software product is often a bottleneck to solve frustrating problems.

Our goal is to reduce the barriers to build.

## How does [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) and [gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app) relate?

The team behind gptengineer.app sprung out of the open source code generation community. We are committed to giving back to it.

Specifically, the mission

> **Maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.

of [**gpt-engineer**](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) inspires us.

Part of the revenue from gptengineer.app will be funding a full time role focused on maintaining open source tools for all codegen builders that is in the works.

The GitHub organisation gpteng-org is created by the original gpt-engineer creator Anton Osika, where gpt-engineer community related projects are collected.

gpt-engineer the CLI tool is goverened by a board that consists of contributors to it, and per default separate from gptengineer.app.


## What's next

We are soon:
- Adding arbitrary full stack capabilities
- Announcing the stacked team and company behind the product
