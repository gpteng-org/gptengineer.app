# gptengineer.app

Our goal is to reduce the barriers to build. Feedback in the shape of bugs or feature requests is super helpful to help us in this.

This is an issues repo for: **[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app)**, a tool for rapid prototyping of web apps.

Feel free to react to tickets you prioritize to help us focus on the issues that matter most.

## What

[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app) enables anyone to:

- Specify what to build
- AI creates a website and display it
- Edit using natural language
- One-click deploy

If you have too many ideas and want to have more products â€“ you might have come to the right place in other words.


The code is not here on github, but you can try it [here](https://gptengineer.app).

## Why
Creating software product is difficult and inaccessible. It is often a bottleneck to solve frustrating problems.

Our goal is to reduce the barriers to build.

## How does gpt-engineer and gptengineer.app relate?

The team behind gptengineer.app sprung out of the open source code generation community. We are committed to giving back to it.

Specifically, we are committed to support the [gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) community mission:
**Maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.

Of the revenue from gptengineer.app we are funding a full time role focused on maintaining open source tools for all codegen builders.

They will work with different codegen projects.

[gpt-engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer) has an independent [board](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/GOVERNANCE.md) that has interesecting interests as the gptengineer.app team.

We are still open to feedback on how we can achieve the mission we want to achieve better and are continuously seeking feedback on how to better.

The GitHub organisation gpteng-org is created by the original gpt-engineer creator Anton Osika, where gpt-engineer community related projects are collected.


## What's next

We are soon:
- Adding arbitrary full stack capabilities
- Announcing the rocketship team and company behind gptengineer.app
- Setting up collaborations between the leading startups in the codegen ecosystem
